FAnToM -- an interactive visualization program for tensor field topology

FAnToM is regularly tested to build and run on
- Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) using g++,
- Mac OSX 10.7.X and Mac OSX 10.8.X using Clang,
- and Windows 7 (using mingw32 and mingw-w64).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

To run a binary version of FAnToM you need the following libraries:

- Python 2.6+ (http://www.python.org)
- Qt 5.1+ (http://www.trolltech.com/qt)

The execution of some algorithms requires additional libraries. Their are
listed in the README file in the toolbox repository. For further
informations visit
http://berkeley.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/trac/FAnToM_dev and
http://berkeley.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/trac/FAnToM_toolboxes.

To build your own plugins we suggest the use of CMake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLUGIN PREREQUISITES

The execution of some FAnToM plugins requires the following libraries

- OpenCL 1.1+,
- NetCDF 4.0+ (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) and

DOCUMENTATION

FAnToM contains specialized documentation for different users.

If you only want to use the program with the standard toolboxes, refer to
the user manual distributed separately.

If you want to extend FAnToM by writing new plugins, refer to FAnToM's
programmer guide available at $PREFIX/share/doc/FAnToM/api where $PREFIX
denotes the path of your FAnToM installation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTERNAL PLUGINS

The development of external plugins is possible with FAnToM.
For an example, unpack the contents of $PREFIX/share/FAnToM/external-plugin.tar.gz
into the directory that you want to build your external toolbox in.
The README there will take you through the basic steps to develop your own plugin.
